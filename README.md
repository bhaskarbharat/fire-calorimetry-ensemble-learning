# fire-calorimetry-ensemble-learning

The NIST Fire Calorimetry Database is an online public resource containing the results of the fire experiments conducted at the National Fire Research Laboratory. The Fire Calorimetry Database (FCD) consists of data augmented videos, images, plots, and tabulated data for more than 1000 full-scale experiments. During each experiment, integrated quantities such as Total Heat Release Rate, Peak Heat Release Rate, and Time to Peak Heat were collected. These measurements were subsequently used as input features for our machine learning analysis. The goals of our analysis are as follows:

1. Can ensemble techniques be used to detect anomalies/outliers?

2. Can ensemble techniques be used to identify the fuel type that is burning and identify features that help in determining this?
